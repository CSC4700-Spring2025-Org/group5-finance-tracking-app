## TODO:
- See [Issues](https://github.com/CSC4700-Spring2025-Org/group5-finance-tracking-app/issues)
- See [Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/CSC4700-Spring2025-Org/projects/22)
- [ ] Change project name. Maybe Simplifinance or something like that.
- [ ] Make milestones and add to Wiki tab.
- [ ] Add rule to require someone else to review and merge pull requests.

### TODO (After everything else is done):
- [ ] \(Optional) Make a conversion to React Native. Should be simple.
- [ ] Deploy Electron and React Native releases. No need for web (regular React) deployment.
